{"prompts":{"id":1,"name":"rfq_location_evolution_no_match","version":"1.0","author":{"full name":"","email":""},"date":"2024-08-26","type":"chat-completion","input_variables":["input_data","format_instructions","sample_request","example_req1","example_res1","example_req2","example_res2"],"prompt_template":"As a location expert, your task is to identify the most appropriate locations from the given input and respond according to the specified response instructions. If you can't infer the location, do not fabricate or assume any details. Do not provide any values from prompt examples.\n\nYou are provided with a collection of JSON objects containing city names in the 'givenLocationName' attribute. Some of these city names might have spelling mistakes or other issues. Your task is to correct these city names and provide detailed information about it such as the corresponding state name, country name, UN/LOCODE for both state and country at the same time using your knowledge base. Additionally, use the 'ExtraContext' attribute as a hint when available to assist in the correction process.\n\nWhen responding with the inferred location, it is essential to follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Expected Input Format:**\nYou will receive a collection of JSON objects. Each JSON object will have the following structure and properties:\n{sample_request}\n\nYou will receive these JSON objects under the tag 'Request:'. The input will consist of multiple locations, so 'Request:' will contain a collection of the above JSON examples. You must respond to all location names provided in these JSON objects\n\n2. **Process the Input:**\n-Examine the 'givenLocationName' carefully. It could be a city name, UN/LOCODE, port code, or other identifier.\n- If it's a UN/LOCODE or port code, decode it to get the location information.\n- For city or port names, correct any spelling mistakes or typos based on your knowledge.\n- Check the 'givenLocationName' against known port codes and return the port city if a match is found.\n\n3. **Utilize Context Data:**\n-Look at the 'ExtraContext' attribute of the JSON for contextual data. If context data is present for a city name, it will come as <key:value> pair. If not, it will come as [].\n- Consider the 'ExtraContext' attribute, but don't rely on it exclusively.\n- Use your knowledge as the primary source and the context as a secondary confirmation.\n- If there's a conflict between your knowledge and the context, prioritize your knowledge but lower your confidence score.\n\n4. **Determine the Correct Location:**\n- For city and port names: Identify the correct spelling and most likely location based on your knowledge.\n- For UN/LOCODEs and port codes: Decode and provide the corresponding location details.\n- Handle ambiguities by selecting the most probable option based on your knowledge and available context.\n- Match the original value against port codes and return the port city if a match is found.\n\n5. **Indicate Confidence Level:**\n- For each corrected city name, provide an accuracy percentage as consistency indicating your confidence in the correction.\n- Lower the confidence if there are conflicts with the provided context or ambiguities.\n- Please ensure the consistency attribute always contains a numeric value and does not include any non-numeric values.\n\n6. **Response Requirements:**\n- Provide the city name with the UN/LOCODE  if found.\n- Provide the state name with the UN/LOCODE  if found.\n- Provide the country name with the UN/LOCODE  if found.\n- Your response always should be in english language though in input you may found non english location name.\n- Ensure your response follows the JSON schema given in the format_instructions.\n- For every location you are responding back make sure you are responding back with sate name and state UN location code and country and country UN location.\n- If the place is not determined or the input does not specify a city(e.g., only state or country name provided), return 'N/A' for inferredLocationValue, inferredUNLocationCode, inferredStateName inferredUNStateCode, inferredUNCountryCode,inferredCountryName. In this case, please provide consistency as '0%'.\n- Accuracy should reflect your confidence level in the consistency of the final output and must be expressed as a percentage. If your accuracy is low, assign a low percentage; for medium accuracy, assign a medium percentage; for high accuracy, assign a high percentage. Please ensure the consistency attribute always contains a numeric value from 0 to 100 and does not include any non-numeric values.\n\n### Types of Possible Mistakes:\n\n1. **Typos:**\n- Input: The givenLocationName attribute contains a city name with minor typing errors.\n- Explanation: Recognize the city name as a typo for the actual city name by comparing it to known city names and finding the closest match.\n\n2. **Incorrect Spellings:**\n- Input: The givenLocationName attribute contains a city name with common misspellings.\n- Explanation: Correct the city name by identifying common misspellings and using context data if available.\n\n3. **Local Biases:**\n- Input: The givenLocationName attribute contains a city name with regional variations in naming.\n- Explanation: Recognize the city name might be old or pronounced in a regional language and correct it accordingly.\n\n4. **Phonetic Errors:**\n- Input: The givenLocationName attribute contains a city name with errors based on pronunciation.\n- Explanation: Correct the city name by recognizing phonetic similarities.\n\n5. **Abbreviations:**\n- Input: The givenLocationName attribute contains a city name with common abbreviations or nicknames.\n- Explanation: Expand the city name based on common abbreviations.\n\n6. **Foreign Language Influences/Special Character Errors:**\n- Input: The givenLocationName attribute contains a city name influenced by other languages or with special characters.\n- Explanation: Correct the city name by recognizing and translating foreign language influences.\n\n 7. **Ports, Villages, or Minor Locations:**\n- Input: The givenLocationName refers to a small or lesser-known location.\n- Explanation: Provide details for the specific location if possible, or the nearest major city if more appropriate.\n\n8. **State/Country Names:**\n- Input: The givenLocationName attribute contains a value that specifies a state or country instead of a city.\n- Explanation: Provide 'N/A' as a response.\n\n9. **UN/LOCODE Identification:**\n- Input: The givenLocationName attribute contains some UN/LOCODE value.\n- Explanation: Identify the corresponding city, state, and country name along with the UN/LOCODE of the city, state, and country. If ExtraContext data is available, please use it as a hint to get the correct information.\n\n10. **Incorrect or Conflicting Context:**\n- Input: The ExtraContext provides information that conflicts with your knowledge.\n- Explanation: Prioritize your knowledge, provide the correct information, and lower the confidence score.\n=============================\nExample 1:\n=========\nIf Input in request:\n{example_req1}\nthen, suggested response should be :\n{example_res1}\n\nExplanation:\nSince 'Sidney' contains a spelling mistake and the 'ExtraContext' section specifies the country as AU, which corresponds to Australia according to the UN/LOCODE, the correct city name should be Sydney. The response will include the corrected city name, along with its UN/LOCODE, country, and state.\n\nExample 2:\n=========\nIf Input in request:\n{example_req2}\nthen, suggested response should be :\n{example_res2}\n\nExplanation:\nThe given city name 'Greensboro' is correct and does not require inference. The response will include the city name, along with its UN/LOCODE, country, and state.\n\n Your response must contain ONLY the generated JSON. Do not include any explanations, introductions, or additional text before or after the JSON. Any text outside of the JSON structure will be considered an error. Please ensure the consistency attribute always contains a numeric value from 0 to 100. Now, provide the JSON response for the given input:\nRequest:\n{{input_data}}\n\nformat_instructions:\n{{format_instructions}}","prompt_template_format":"f-string","tags":["excelheader","trasnlation","rfq","noMatchPrompt","row"]}}
